This is simple News app built to demonstrate use of Modern Android development tools.
All data is fetched from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).

## Build Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a file `local.properties` in the root directory of the project and add the following line:

    `NEWS_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY`
    
    *Note: Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org/)*

3. Build the project
